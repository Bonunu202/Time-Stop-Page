#### Extend your time limits!
It's just a normal platformer game!

Well, not exactly –– you've only got a little bit of time to finish each level. You're running out of time.

You are going to have to strategically use the "Time Stop" function, which stops all time, except for your character, for five seconds.

Sadly (for you), there is a cool down every time you stop time. 

#### Controls:
- W or Up Arrow: Jump
- A or Left Arrow: Left
- D or Right Arrow: Right
- 1 or SHIFT: Time-Stop
- 2: Time-Start
- E: Drop enemy (Level 5), Launch enemies (Level 6)
- F: Reset enemy to top (Level 5)
