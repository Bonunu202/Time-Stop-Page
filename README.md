**Latest Announcement:** 
*November 30, 2020*
Time-Stop Version 1.5.0 is coming out soon!

The holiday season has begun!
We've made many new changes in version 1.5.0 for iPhone, iPad and Mac:
 • Fixed area where players would be unable to move in the tutorial level
 • Other bug fixes and improvements
 • New App Store screenshots to show our winter theme

#### Extend your time limits!
It's just a normal platformer game!

Well, not exactly –– you've only got a little bit of time to finish each level. You're running out of time.

You are going to have to strategically use the "Time Stop" function, which stops all time, except for your character, for five seconds.

Sadly (for you), there is a cool down every time you stop time. 

#### Controls:
- W or Up Arrow: Jump
- A or Left Arrow: Left
- D or Right Arrow: Right
- 1 or SHIFT: Time-Stop
- 2: Time-Start
- E: Drop enemy
- F: Reset enemy to top
